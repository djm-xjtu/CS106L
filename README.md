# CS106L

## It is Stanford C++ lecture which is awesome. It could help you write high-quality c++ code.

## When I studied in Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, I learnt c++ only c plus cin/cout, no more modern c++ methods. In this lecture you can learn a lot of c++ skills like lambda function, STL and algorithm systematicall, RALL, mutithread, smartpointer etc.

## This repository is finished labs which may give you some help when you learn this lecture. 

## Whatever, good luck!
